Description = 
This project leverages computer vision to create a gesture-based control system for media players.
By using a webcam to detect and track hand movements, the system recognizes specific hand gestures to control playback, volume, and navigation of media content.
With the integration of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, the project offers a hands-free, intuitive way to interact with media players like YouTube or VLC, making it a useful tool for presentations, watching videos, or listening to music without needing to touch a keyboard or mouse.
